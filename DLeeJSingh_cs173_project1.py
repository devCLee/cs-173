This program simulates a situation where there are two people, and each person enters the kitchen starting at midnight, stays for a certain period, and then leaves for a specific amount of time, repeating this cycle throughout the day. At a specific time, starting at midnight, Soprano the cat attempts to hop up on the counter. The program determines whether Soprano succeeds if no one is in the kitchen or gets caught if someone is.
